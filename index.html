            <p>Portugal is a country in southern Europe, located on the Iberian Peninsula and bordering Spain. Its location on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean has influenced many aspects of the country's culture: salted cod and grilled sardines are typical national dishes, the beaches of the Algarve are popular destinations and much of the country's architecture dates back to the 16th to 19th centuries, when Portugal was a powerful maritime empire.</p>
