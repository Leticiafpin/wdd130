                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Rafting Club was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate whitewater enthusiasts who wanted to share the thrill of river rafting with the world. Starting with just a handful of rafts and a deep knowledge of the local rivers, they set out to create unforgettable experiences for adventurers of all levels. <br>

                    In the early days, the company operated out of a small riverside shack, but the founders’ commitment to safety, quality, and environmental stewardship quickly earned them a loyal following. By focusing on personalized service and fostering a sense of community, Rafting Club became known as the go-to place for authentic rafting adventures. <br>
                    
                    Over the years, the company expanded its fleet, trained a dedicated team of expert guides, and introduced innovative rafting trips that highlighted the beauty and excitement of the region’s waterways. They also became active in river conservation efforts, understanding that protecting the environment was key to their purpose. <br>
                    
                    Today, Rafting Club is a leader in the industry, offering a wide range of rafting experiences, from serene family floats to adrenaline-pumping rapid runs. Their motto, “Ride the Rapids, Live the Adventure!” continues to inspire both the team and their guests to embrace the adventure that awaits on the river.</p>
